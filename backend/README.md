 To use HTTPS in your Express app, you need an SSL certificate. For local development, you can generate a self-signed certificate, but for production, you should use a certificate from a trusted CA (Certificate Authority).

# Install mkcert and setup and create a self signed CA for localhost
 - This certificate will be placed in your keychain system certifcates
```bash
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost
```

# Name the certificate security and add the certificate to your security folder
```bash
cd security
mkcert server
cd ..
```

# Future considerations: 
For Production SSL Certificate: Obtain your SSL certificate from a trusted CA for your production environment.
Database Security: Ensure that your database connections are also secure and use encrypted connections if possible.
API Security Best Practices: Consider other security practices such as API throttling, more sophisticated rate limiting, and using OAuth for better authentication mechanisms.
